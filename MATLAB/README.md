MATLAB version of the example.
==============================

# Pre-requisites:
- Install CasADi, following the instruction [here](https://web.casadi.org/get/).

# Brief file description:
- `main.m` contains the main script to formulate and solve the trajectory optimization problem. Running this script should take about 1-2s. Different walking styles can be generated by adjusting the variable `selected_gait`.
- `eulerIntegrator.m` describes the backward Euler integration scheme.
- `generateSymbolicFunctions.m` generates (symbolically) multiple functions describing, among other, the equations of motion and the heel-strike map equations. Those functions are then used as part of the main script.
All the generated functions have been included in this repository. There is therefore no need to re-run this function before running `main.m`. However, if users are interested in changing/extending the model, they will need to regenerate for instance the equations of motion.
